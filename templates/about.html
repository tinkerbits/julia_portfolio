            <p>I was born in Estonia. When I was 6, my family moved to Berlin. After graduating in Cartography in Berlin I moved to Barcelona, where I met my boyfriend. Soon (too soon) he got a job offer from London and we decided to make the move together. Then, on a sunny winterday in 2018, our lovely daughter ZoÃ« was born. Recently she has been eager to pick up a pencil too and join me in my drawing sessions.</p>

            <p>I loved art from a very young age and liked drawing from time to time but never trusted my skills enough to pursue a career in art. Following tutorials on YouTube, collecting ideas and inspiration encouraged me to start drawing more often and gaining confidence. Artists I admire are Nina Cosford, ... , ... Currently, I love experimenting with mixing different media (such as pencils, markers and watercolours) and practise a loose sketchy style.</p>

            <p>When I'm not busy with my daughter or work, I also like discovering new places or walking in nature. During these I make sure to take my camera with me as I have a passion for photography and really enjoy caputuring a nice spot or moment.</p>
